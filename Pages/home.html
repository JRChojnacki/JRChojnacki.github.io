                            I had a great pleasure to be a part of the Wolfram Summer School 2021. During the 4 weeks of intensive work, under the guidance of brilliant Jonathan Gorard, I have investigated dimension decay of dynamically generated hypergraphs.

                            I will be a part of Krzysztof Meissner's research team investigating effects of the symmetries of string-inspired gravity, in the early universe.  Our research is funded by <div class="intext-link-wrapper"><a href="https://inicjatywadoskonalosci.uw.edu.pl/en/actions/ni/pob2/" target="_blank" >New Ideas in Priority Research Area</a></div> program.

I feel honored representing the University of Warsaw, among 10 of the finalists in the category "Physics and Astronomy". The prize is awarded to Polish students for outstanding performance in one of the nine categories. The assessment includes scientific contribution, voluntary work, and social impact. During the last stage of the competition, the winner in each category will be awarded 5000 PLN.

We find that the Finite Action Principle resolves singularity problem in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Singular black hole solutions do not contribute path integral, however, the worm holes seem to be allowed in the finite action context.

The four of us are going to represent Poland during the remote 36-hour-long international tournament. This edition of PLANCKS is going to be unlike any other- any online resource may be used during solving 12 extremely difficult problems. The problems cover a broad spectrum of theoretical physics. The competition will take place 6-9 May 2021.
